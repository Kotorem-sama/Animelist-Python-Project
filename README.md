# Animelist-Python-Project
Will be converted to an actual application in c# one day i guess.
Todolist:
- put backup in appdata if possible
- thing to check if myanimelist page exists
- If the lists folder does not exist create a new one
- completed list
- on hold list
- dropped list
- days watched calculator
- making code more readable and clean
- Make a statistics page where you can see how many percentage you've completed from a certain genre/studio/etc.
- Make a function that automaticly checks for new anime on myanimelist (figure out how to do that as a background process)
- Make it possible to watch anime on the application by copying the video url from the existing website with bs4
- Setting so you can't find hentai or mild nudity anime if you don't want to.
- Function for finding censored/uncensored versions of anime if they exist.'
- When a link has been found for where you can watch an anime it will save this somewhere.
- If possible make a function that searches for raw episodes. (Japanese version without subtitles of any kind)
- If possible make a function that searches for its English subtitles.
- Make a function that translates subtitles to other languages.
- Make a function for selecting sub or dub. (Only dubbed in english though)
- Add a separate couple of lists for keeping track of manga.
- Make a function that searches for websites with manga.
- Make the project an exe with pyinstaller. (I'm not sure if i'll actually do this though)
- Make a GUI with either Tkinter, PyQt, PySide or KIVY. (Do some research)
- Make a function for getting the anime cover(s).
- Make a page for the currently airing anime.
- Make a character page.
- Make a function that remembers the episode and time where you stopped watching.
- Make it possible to search for more than one genre.
- Add the rest of the MyAnimeList information about the anime that you think won't change. For older anime take the popularity.
- Add custom genres. Example: "Add genre 'Balls' for every anime with 'Action', 'Slice of Life', 'Mild Nudity' and 'Kyoto Animation'.

probably impossible for me:
- Function to blur nude parts somehow idk.
- Make a manga reader somehow idk.
- Make a login page + advanced data protection??
- Add a function so it's possible to cast stuff to TV's.
